If you downloaded a source package, just execute

    $ python setup.py install

and copy the configuration file to /etc:

    # cp /usr/share/crtwo2fits/crtwo2fits.conf /etc

If you cloned the source from the git repo, then you must firts run

    $ ./configure

It is advisable however to make a package compatible with the package manager
of your distribution and use the latter instead of running the installation
script manually.
